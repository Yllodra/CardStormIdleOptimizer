# Card Storm Idle Optimizer
This program takes the current inputs, such as current cards bought (upgrades) and suggests the next optimal card to purchase.

This is meant to provide a real project for me to learn Python and the GUI Tkinter with. As such it will likely never be finished. As it is a work in progress it has plenty of TODOs in the code. Those TODOs should, if this was a more serious project, be moved into the issue tracker rather than be in the code itself.
